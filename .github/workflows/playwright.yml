# Railway E2E Testing Configuration (#1170, #1191)
# Tests run against Railway STAGING environment (isolated from production)
# See playwright.config.ts for how these env vars are used
#
# Staging Environment Benefits (#1191):
# - Isolated database (no data pollution)
# - Rate limiting DISABLED (no 429 errors)
# - Dedicated test users (no auth conflicts)
# - Safe for destructive tests
#
# Performance Optimizations:
# - Sharding: Tests split across 3 parallel runners for ~60% faster execution
# - AI tests excluded: sections-generation-*.spec.ts run in nightly workflow
# - Rate limiting disabled on staging (no delays needed)
