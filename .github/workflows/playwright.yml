# Railway E2E Testing Configuration (#1170)
# Tests run against Railway production environment
# See playwright.config.ts for how these env vars are used
#
# Rate Limiting Strategy (#1186):
# - Single worker (PLAYWRIGHT_WORKERS=1) to serialize test execution
# - Inter-test delays in Auth tests (1s) via rate-limit-helper.ts
# - Post-login delays (500ms) to respect 5 req/min limit on /auth/login
# - Rate limit monitoring logs 429 responses for debugging
# - Timeout increased to 45min to accommodate delays + retries
