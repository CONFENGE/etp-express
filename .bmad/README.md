# BMAD Method - ETP Express Integration

**Version:** 6.0.0-alpha (customized for B2G)
**Project:** ETP Express
**Integration Date:** 2025-12-11

---

## 🎯 Overview

BMAD (Build More, Architect Dreams) Method is an AI-driven agile development framework integrated into ETP Express to elevate technical rigor, optimize development processes, and systematically resolve P0 issues with enterprise-grade quality.

**Key Benefits:**

- 🏗️ **Structured Planning:** PRDs, Tech Specs, and Stories for all complex features
- 📊 **Token Optimization:** 70-85% savings via document sharding and helper patterns
- 🔄 **4-Phase Workflow:** Analysis → Planning → Solutioning → Implementation
- 🎯 **Scale-Adaptive:** Quick Flow (< 5min) to Enterprise Track (< 30min)
- ✅ **Compliance-First:** Lei 14.133/2021, LGPD, WCAG 2.1 AA, OWASP Top 10

---

## 📋 Four-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Analysis (Optional)

**Command:** `/product-brief-etp <ISSUE_NUMBER>`

**Agent:** Business Analyst

**When to use:**

- Ambiguous requirements
- New feature domain
- Complex technical decisions

**Output:** `docs/product-briefs/issue-<NUMBER>-brief.md`

**Deliverables:**

- Executive summary
- Problem statement with impact assessment
- User stories
- Solution alternatives
- Market research

---

### Phase 2: Planning (Required for P0)

**Command:** `/prd-etp <ISSUE_NUMBER>`

**Agent:** Product Manager

**When to use:**

- All P0 Security issues
- All P0 Enterprise Launch issues
- Complex features (5+ files)

**Output:** `docs/prds/issue-<NUMBER>-prd.md`

**Deliverables:**

- Functional Requirements (FRs)
- Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
- Compliance requirements (LGPD, WCAG, OWASP, Lei 14.133)
- Success metrics (technical + business KPIs)
- Risk matrix with mitigations

---

### Phase 3: Solutioning (Required)

**Command:** `/tech-spec-etp <ISSUE_NUMBER>`

**Agent:** System Architect

**When to use:**

- Always, after PRD is created

**Output:** `docs/tech-specs/issue-<NUMBER>-tech-spec.md`

**Deliverables:**

- Architecture decisions (with alternatives considered)
- Implementation plan (file-by-file breakdown)
- API changes (endpoints, contracts)
- Database migrations (SQL scripts)
- Testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E)
- Performance considerations
- Security & accessibility analysis

**Optional:** `docs/architecture/ADR-<NUMBER>-<title>.md` (if significant decision)

---

### Phase 4: Implementation (Required)

**Command:** `/story-etp <ISSUE_NUMBER>`

**Agent:** Scrum Master

**When to use:**

- Always, after Tech Spec is created

**Output:** `docs/stories/issue-<NUMBER>-story.md`

**Deliverables:**

- Hyper-contextualized implementation story
- Step-by-step guide (phases 1-7)
- Concrete code snippets (TypeScript, not TODOs)
- Test cases (Given/When/Then)
- Definition of Done (specific, measurable)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Example: Resolve Issue #611 (Polling AI após unmount)

```bash
# Phase 1 (Optional): Create product brief
/product-brief-etp 611

# Phase 2: Create PRD
/prd-etp 611

# Phase 3: Create Tech Spec
/tech-spec-etp 611

# Phase 4: Create Implementation Story
/story-etp 611

# Execute implementation (manual or via agent)
# Follow steps in docs/stories/issue-611-story.md

# Quality review (future command)
# /review-quality <PR_NUMBER>
```

- **Velocity:** 3-5 P0 issues/week (with BMAD)
- **Quality:** Zero regressions in BMAD-driven PRs
- **Coverage:** Maintain or improve 78%/76%

### Processes

- **Planning time (Quick Flow):** < 5 min
- **Planning time (BMAD Method):** < 15 min
- **Planning time (Enterprise):** < 30 min
- **Documentation coverage:** 100% for P0 issues

### Quality

- **Review time:** < 24h for PRs with complete stories
- **Rollback rate:** < 2% (well-documented decisions)

---

## 🔄 Integration with Existing Workflow

### Preserved Commands

- `/audit-roadmap` - Syncs with ROADMAP.md (unchanged)
- `/pick-next-issue` - Pipeline mode, max 3 PRs (unchanged)
- `/review-pr` - PR review with coverage checks (unchanged)

### Enhanced Pipeline

**Before:**

1. `/pick-next-issue` → Selects issue
2. Implement directly
3. `/review-pr` → Review and merge

**With BMAD (for P0 issues):**

1. `/pick-next-issue` → Selects P0 issue
2. `/prd-etp <ISSUE>` → Create PRD
3. `/tech-spec-etp <ISSUE>` → Create Tech Spec
4. `/story-etp <ISSUE>` → Create Story
5. Implement following story guidance
6. `/review-pr` → Review and merge

**Net benefit:**

- Higher quality (fewer bugs, better tests)
- Faster review (clear context in story)
- Better documentation (PRD, Tech Spec, Story)

---

## 🛠️ Usage Guidelines

### When to Use BMAD Workflow

✅ **Always use for:**

- P0 Security issues (#598-#602)
- P0 Enterprise Launch issues (#578-#597)
- Features with 5+ files
- Database migrations
- API breaking changes
- Complex UI refactors

⚠️ **Consider using for:**

- Medium features (3-5 files)
- Bug fixes with unclear scope
- Refactoring with trade-offs

❌ **Skip for:**

- Typos and doc updates
- One-line fixes
- Simple CSS tweaks

### Command Sequence

**Typical flow:**

```
/product-brief-etp <ISSUE> (optional)
↓
/prd-etp <ISSUE> (required for P0)
↓
/tech-spec-etp <ISSUE> (required)
↓
/story-etp <ISSUE> (required)
↓
Implement
↓
/review-pr <PR_NUMBER> (existing)
```

**Fast track (for clear issues):**

```
/prd-etp <ISSUE>
↓
/tech-spec-etp <ISSUE>
↓
/story-etp <ISSUE>
↓
Implement
```

## 🎯 Token Optimization

### Document Sharding

Large documents (ROADMAP.md, ARCHITECTURE.md) are sharded into helpers:

- `{{helper:roadmap/metrics}}` → `.bmad/helpers/roadmap/metrics.md`
- `{{helper:architecture/backend-stack}}` → `.bmad/helpers/architecture/backend-stack.md`

**Token savings:** ~90% for repeated references

### Functional Design

Agents focus on deliverables, not personas:

- ❌ **Before:** "As an experienced architect, I would recommend..."
- ✅ **After:** "Recommendation: Use AbortController for cleanup"

**Token savings:** ~20% per response

---

## 📚 Templates

All templates are in `.bmad/templates/`:

- **prd-template.md** - 13 sections, compliance-focused
- **tech-spec-template.md** - 17 sections, implementation-focused
- **story-template.md** - 7 phases, step-by-step guidance
- **adr-template.md** - Architecture Decision Record
