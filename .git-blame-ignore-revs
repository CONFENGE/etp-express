# Git blame ignore file
# This file tells git-blame to skip certain commits (e.g., formatting, mass refactors)
# Configure with: git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs

# NOTE: This file can be used to hide AI-assisted commits from blame view
# Add commit SHAs here if needed (one per line)
# Example:
# abc123def456  # chore: mass formatting by tooling
